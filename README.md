# Typescript HTTP Server
### an excercise in locking in

You know that feeling when you're working on a programming side project that has matured a lot and you're like "*Wow I have such a rhythym to these features I'm shipping now that I feel very comfortable doing so*". That is called complacency, otherwise known as the place learning goes to die. 

Now, have you ever felt that moment when you are working on a project and you feel like if you go one more hour of running in circles that you will change your life plans to go study under the dumbest person in history to learn how to get smarter? 

**That is learning**


It is the chasing of that intellectual suffering that drove me to write this project. To decide to learn the next hard thing in order to level up.

If you would for some reason want to mess with this project you can grab it by:
> git clone https://github.com/TheFirstHero6/Typescript-HTTP-server.git


> cd Typescript-HTTP-Server

> run the server with ./your_program.sh

> flame me on stack overflow (Mandatory step)
